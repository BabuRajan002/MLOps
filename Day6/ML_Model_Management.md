# Machine Learning Model management 

- It encompases the practices, tools, amd methids involved in ML models from development tp prod. Effective model management ensures that machine learning models are scalable, maintainable, and consistently deliver value.

- ***Dataprocessing***
Data processing in machine learning refers to the crucial set of operations and transformations performed on raw data to prepare it for use in training machine learning models. This process is essential because raw data is often messy, incomplete, inconsistent, or in a format unsuitable for direct use by algorithms. The goal is to transform this raw data into a clean, structured, and usable format that enables models to learn meaningful patterns and make accurate predictions.

- ***Data Versioning***

Refers to the process of systematically tracking and managing changes to datasets used in training and testing models to ensure reproducibility, auditability, and effective model management ! 

- ***Experiment Tracking***

Enabled systematically monitoring the models
