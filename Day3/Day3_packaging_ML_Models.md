# Packaging ML Models

## What is a Model?

- A **model** is an algorithm that has been **trained on a large dataset** to perform a **specific task** such as prediction, classification, or recommendation.

## Packaging the Model

- **Model packaging** refers to the process of preparing a trained ML model for **deployment** in a production environment.  
- **Docker** is one of the most widely used tools for **packaging and containerizing machine learning models**, ensuring consistent deployment and execution across different environments.

## Additional Tools for Model Packaging

- **Conda** – A package and environment manager primarily for Python, but also supports other programming languages.  
- **MLflow** – Helps manage the ML lifecycle including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.  
- **TensorFlow** – Provides built-in tools for saving and serving trained models.  
- **Kubeflow** – A Kubernetes-native platform for developing, orchestrating, and deploying ML workflows.  
- **PyTorch** – Offers utilities for saving and loading models, often integrated with TorchServe for deployment.

## Steps in Model Packaging

1. **Train the Model** – Build and train the ML model on your dataset.  
2. **Dependency Management** – Capture all required libraries, frameworks, and runtime dependencies.  
3. **Environment Isolation** – Use containers or virtual environments to ensure consistency.  
4. **Version Control** – Track model versions, parameters, and configurations for reproducibility.  
5. **Documentation** – Document setup instructions, dependencies, and usage guidelines.  
6. **Testing** – Validate the packaged model to ensure it performs as expected before deployment.

## Experimentation Phase

- Before deployment, conduct **experimentation** to fine-tune the model.  
- This includes **setting up the environment**, installing **dependencies**, and verifying **compatibility** and **performance** under controlled conditions.
